    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>I've often found that a lot of online generators tend to focus on quantity instead of quality, leading to a lot of strange results.
        There's nothing inherently wrong with this approach - in fact, it can be useful in a lot of cases.
        <br> This, however, has never truly fit my needs, so I decided to make my own, in which names are more curated and any prefix/suffix
        construction is controlled more than usual. I want results I personally would use, in situations I would want to use them.
        <br> You might find some of the generators to be too specific for your own use, or trend a little different than you'd expect. This
        is a side effect of that philosophy.
