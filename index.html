    <h1>Welcome to Bruck's Name Generator!</h1>

    <p>I've always been slightly dissatisfied with most online generators; I find them to be fairly poorly curated and contain a lot of options that I wouldn't really use. So, I made my own.
        <br>Hover over a genre of namelist in the navbar and select your desired namelist; subraces are included in the overarching race; i.e., drow is under the elf category.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>Note: you may need to clear your cache after the namelists are updated for new additions to show up in the generator.</p>
