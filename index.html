    <p>I've always been slightly dissatisfied with most online generators; I find them to be fairly poorly curated and contain a lot of options that I wouldn't really use. This is my answer to that, and nothing more.
        <br>Hover over a genre of namelist in the navbar and select your desired namelist; subraces are included in the overarching race; i.e., drow is under the elf category.

    <p>There's also a desktop app with limited generation but high creation functionality. See the Github repo for more information.
        <br>I'm mostly an embedded and Python programmer - the Desktop app was the designed first and is a little more feature complete.
